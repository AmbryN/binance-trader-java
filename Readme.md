# Binance Java Trading Bot

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

It allows :
* To select a crypto pair to trade from the available pairs
* To select a trading strategy from the available list

Planned features :
* Trade a specific crypto pair (e.g. BTCUSDT) by sending actual buy and sell orders using Binance's wallet balance
* Select and use a trading strategy (e.g. Moving Average) with variable bservation period, number of periods used for the moving average calculation and refresh time of the bot

## Todo
* Implement Moving Average strategy
* Send buy/sell orders
